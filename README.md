<p align=center>the first browser gabai has ever build (and the simplest)</p>
<br>

# What is this?
This is a pretty simple browser made by me, in PyQt5, and some basic features
<br>
<br>

# How to use
It's pretty easy, you gotta go to releases and download the release for your os.
<br>
<br>

for source code, you gotta have git, pip and python installed, and after that you will need to run ***git clone https://github.com/gabaznv/gabaiWeb.git*** and ***pip install PyQt5 PyQt5WebEngine***
<br>
<br>

# Features
as i've said, this browser has some basic features, like:
<br>
        - Go back/forward
        <br>
        - Reload the page
        <br>
        - Go to home page
        <br>
        - Go on local websites
        <br>
        - Settings (still in development)

<br>
<br>
(more features will be added on the next update)
<br>
<br>

# Why?
again, idk, just came on my mind
